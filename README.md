String distance functions for R

String distance functions are scattered around R, and R's packages. This package
is a re-implementation of some common (weighted) distance functions, offered
through a uniform interface. So far distance functions include:

* Hamming distance; 
* Levenshtein distance (weighted);
* Restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance (weighted);
* Full Damerau-Levenshtein distance (weighted).

Core algorithms are implemented in C, for speed.
